### Project Title: Augmented Reality Earth Rotation on QR Code Scan

---

### Project Overview
This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) experience that uses Unity and Vuforia (or AR Foundation for broader AR device compatibility) to display a rotating 3D Earth model. Upon scanning a QR code, a globe appears and begins to rotate, providing an immersive and interactive educational tool for visualizing Earth. This application can be deployed on mobile devices, utilizing the device's camera for QR code recognition and AR visualization.

---

### Project Objectives
1. **AR Earth Visualization**: Display a realistic 3D model of the Earth that can rotate continuously once the QR code is scanned.
2. **QR Code Triggering**: Enable QR code scanning functionality to initiate the AR experience, making it accessible and interactive.
3. **User-Friendly Interaction**: Design a smooth and immersive AR interaction with simple controls to start, pause, or stop the rotation of the Earth.

---

### Features
- **QR Code Recognition**: Recognizes a specific QR code to trigger the appearance of the Earth model.
- **Realistic 3D Earth Model**: Uses a high-quality 3D model of Earth with texture mapping to display continents, oceans, and details.
- **Continuous Rotation**: The Earth model rotates at a fixed speed when displayed in AR, simulating real-world Earth rotation.
- **User Control Options**: Allows users to pause or resume rotation by tapping the model.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Built for Android and iOS devices with Unity’s AR capabilities for cross-platform deployment.

---

### Technologies Used
1. **Unity**: 3D development platform used to create the AR experience.
2. **Vuforia**: AR SDK in Unity (or AR Foundation for ARCore and ARKit compatibility) for QR code recognition and AR capabilities.
3. **Blender/3DS Max**: For creating or importing the 3D model of the Earth with detailed textures.
4. **C#**: Programming language used within Unity for scripting rotation, QR code scanning triggers, and user interactions.

### Project Structure

- **Assets**
  - `Models/`: Contains the 3D model of the Earth with necessary textures.
  - `Scripts/`: Contains C# scripts for rotation control, QR code detection, and user interaction management.
  - `Materials/`: Includes Earth textures for realistic surface details.
  - `Scenes/`: Unity scenes that house the AR camera and Earth model setup.
  
- **Scripts**
  - `QREarthController.cs`: Handles QR code recognition and triggers Earth model activation in AR.
  - `EarthRotation.cs`: Controls Earth rotation speed, direction, and pause/resume functionality.
  
- **Libraries**
  - Unity libraries for Vuforia (or AR Foundation) integration, handling AR features and compatibility with mobile devices.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Unity**:
   - Download and install Unity (version 2020 or later is recommended).
   
2. **Import Vuforia SDK**:
   - Open Unity Hub, create a new 3D project, and import the Vuforia SDK (or AR Foundation for broader support).

3. **Add Earth Model**:
   - Import a 3D Earth model and textures into the Unity project under `Assets/Models/`.

4. **Create and Configure Scene**:
   - Set up the AR camera, add the Earth model, and ensure it is scaled appropriately within the AR space.
   
5. **Implement QR Code Recognition**:
   - Use Vuforia's image target feature to recognize the QR code and trigger the display of the Earth model.
   
6. **Script the Rotation**:
   - Attach the `EarthRotation.cs` script to the Earth model to enable rotation. Set parameters such as rotation speed and direction.

7. **Test and Build**:
   - Test the experience in Unity, ensuring smooth QR code recognition and Earth model rotation. Once finalized, build the app for Android or iOS.

### Usage Guide

1. **Open the App**: Launch the AR app on a mobile device.
2. **Scan the QR Code**: Point the device camera at the designated QR code.
3. **View and Interact**: Once detected, the Earth model appears in AR, rotating on its axis. Tap on the model to pause or resume rotation.
