# Earth360-AR
This AR project uses Unity and Vuforia (or AR Foundation) to display a rotating 3D Earth model triggered by scanning a QR code. Upon scanning, a globe appears and starts rotating, offering an immersive educational tool for visualizing Earth. The app is deployable on mobile devices, utilizing the camera for QR code recognition and AR display.
